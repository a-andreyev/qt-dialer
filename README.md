draft telephone handset qml emulator
## Details

Write a GUI application to simulate a telephone handset.
The interface should be made of 12 buttons and a one-line display area.
The buttons are arranged in a 4 (rows) X 3 (columns) grid and they represent values from 0 – 9,
one to initiate the call and another to cancel the call.

When the user clicks on the number buttons, the selected numbers should appear in the display area
appended to the previously selected numbers.

Once the user has selected some numbers, he/she can click on the call button,
which will change the display to say ‘calling ….’ (include the number dialled).

When the user selects the cancel button, the display should show the total duration
(from when the call button was selected) of the call on the display area.
